# MEMORY CARD GAME

This is a simple web-based matching game that helps you exercise your memory.
This project was undertaken to practice the use of jQuery in addition to previously learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages.

### Installation
- Open the memoryGame.html file in any web browser and start the game by clicking on a card. (_Chrome is recommended_)

### How the game works
1. Start the game by clicking on any card on the deck. The timer will start, to keep track of how long it will take you to finish the game.
2. Click on a second card and if it matches the first, they stay face up. If it doesn't, both cards turn back down in a second or on your third click.
3. Repeat steps one and two till you have all cards matched.
4. Two consecutive card clicks are recorded as a move.
5. Keep your total moves under 12 to finish with all three stars. You lose a star when 12 moves are recorded and another when you 16 moves are recorded.
6. At the end of the game, you will have a preview of your stats; total time of play, number of remainind stars and number of moves recorded. 
7. You can then restart the game and play again.

        ENJOY!
